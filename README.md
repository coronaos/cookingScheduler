# cookingScheduler
Python Script who takes all the dishes written on an excel and create a random schedule in PDF of everyday of the week. If it has a "5" in the next column it means is Friday Dish. That's because you shouldn't be eating fast food on a Tuesday, so these dishes will only appear in Friday night.

This is bc I live alone and I don't want to think all the time what I'm going to eat.

kisses to everyone.
